# TechieShop MERN Stack eCommerce

It boasts a robust user authentication system, with an administrative user role that empowers users to add new products, manage orders, and oversee payments. Furthermore, administrators have the capability to mark orders as delivered. The application seamlessly integrates with PayPal for payment processing and is hosted on Render.
